## New chapter of gas hydrate

clathrate hydrates, also called gas hydrate, clatherates, hydrates.
Are crystalline water-based soild. It is a cluster of molecules with water-molecules-formed cage containung gas molecules.
Without the guest molecules (typically gas molecule), the clathrates would collapse into ice crystal.
The formation of gas hydrate is first order phase transitions, not chemical reactions.
