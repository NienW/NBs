## Abstract
The supersaturated aqueous solution, by electrolysis, can form gas bubbles sized ~100 nm. The ability of cleaning contaminants is evaluated in this paper. Both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces are evaluated by adding bovine serum albumin and lysozyme.

## Conclusion
NBs are able to clean fouled hydronphilic surfaces, but not obvious on hydrophbic surfaces. NBs are able to prevent contaminants fouling onto surfaces. However, this fouling prevention decreased when concentration of contaminants increases. Therefore, the most important role of NBs in cleaning might be preventing redeposition of contaminants during mechnical agitation.
