## Conclusion
NBs are able to clean fouled hydronphilic surfaces, but not obvious on hydrophbic surfaces. NBs are able to prevent contaminants fouling onto surfaces. However, this fouling prevention decreased when concentration of contaminants increases. Therefore, the most important role of NBs in cleaning might be preventing redeposition of contaminants during mechnical agitation.
