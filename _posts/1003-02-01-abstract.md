### Abstract
Using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of graphene liquid cells (GLCs) to investigate water in different condition.

### Conclusion
Two major structure are detected in gas-supersaturated water: individual polycrystalline nanoparticle and clathrate structure.
aces, but not obvious on hydrophbic surfaces. NBs are able to prevent contaminants fouling onto surfaces. However, this fouling prevention decreased when concentration of contaminants increases. Therefore, the most important role of NBs in cleaning might be preventing redeposition of contaminants during mechnical agitation.
